# Modern Compiler Implementation in C
* Follow the famous Tiger Book. [Course website @ IPADS](http://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/compilers/)
* This is the 1st time for SE@SJTU to use this book and labs, hope can help the subsequent students.
* There still exist a great many bugs in the labs before lab6b, as a result of the **too naive** test script.
